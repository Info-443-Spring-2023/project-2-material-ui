# Checkpoint 1

**Forked Project:**
https://github.com/lwong121/info-443-p2-material-ui

**Chosen Project:** Material UI
- Github Project: https://github.com/mui/material-ui
- Documentation: https://mui.com/core/

**What is the software system, and what does it do?** Give a short (a few sentences is fine) explanation from a user/consumer perspective.

Material UI is a open-source library offering various pre-built React components that implment Google's Material Design.

**Who created the software, and who currently "maintains" it?** (Was it developed by a large company or an independent developer? Who seems to be in charge of approving changes to its code/architecture?)
