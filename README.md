# Checkpoint 1

**Chosen Project:** Moment
- https://github.com/moment/moment
- https://momentjs.com/docs/

**What is the software system, and what does it do?** Give a short (a few sentences is fine) explanation from a user/consumer perspective.

Moment.js is a open-source JavaScript library that allows you to easily parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates and times.

**Who created the software, and who currently "maintains" it?** (Was it developed by a large company or an independent developer? Who seems to be in charge of approving changes to its code/architecture?)

Moment.js was created in 2011 in the moment team. The project is currently a legacy project in maintenance mode; therefore, in the team's words, "it is not dead, but it is indeed done".
